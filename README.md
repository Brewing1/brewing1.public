This repository contains selected material from my private repositories that are suitable for public viewing. It consists of coding examples (in Python) as well as some articles written with Jupyter - all of which are about team sport modelling. 

I've given each article in "Jupyter Notebook" a "Technical Rating (TR)" from 0 to 5 with 5 being the most technical. These appear in the article titles. e.g. 'Article Example (TR3)'.

The articles often refer to 'ELO' which is the rating system used by chess to determine player strength. If you haven't heard of ELO before, it may help to have a glimpse at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Theory before reading the articles.
