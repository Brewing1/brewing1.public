This repository contains selected material from my private repositories that are suitable for public viewing. It consists of coding examples (in Python) as well as some articles written with Jupyter - all of which are about team sport modelling. 

I've given each article in "Jupyter Notebook" a "Technical Rating (TR)" from 0 to 5 with 5 being the most technical. These appear in the article titles. e.g. 'Article Example (TR3)'.
